Andyroo iOS application

The Andyroo application is for those who are interested in my music band Andyroo.  I don't believe there are any or many apps dedicated to the music of a single music group, and this is a way for me to demo my music and videos, offer a musical biography and provide band updates and tour information.  The Andyroo app consists of 4 tabbed views: Home, Music, Videos, and Bio.  And I'm going to add a Tour+ view that will pull band updates and tour information from my music web domain ANDYROO.COM. The Music view embeds audio players for 3 of my songs and a button link to my iTunes catalog for digital music downloads. The Videos view embeds several music vidoes and button links to my webpage ANDYROO.COM and YouTube channel.  My Bio view gives a biography of my life as a musician and computer scientist. The app is still a work in progress, and not quite ready for the app store, but should be soon. Enjoy!
