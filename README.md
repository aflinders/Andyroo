Andyroo iOS application

The Andyroo application is for those who are interested in my music band Andyroo.  I don't believe there are any or many apps dedicated to the music of a single music group, and this is a way for me to demo my music and videos, offer a musical biography and provide band updates and tour information.

The Andyroo app consists of 4 tabbed views: Home, Music, Videos, and Bio. The Music view embeds audio players for 3 of my songs and a button link to my iTunes catalog for digital music downloads. The Bio view gives a biography of my life as a musician and computer scientist.  The Videos view embeds a web-view for watching my music videos and button links to my webpage ANDYROO.COM and my YouTube channel.  This view requires an Internet connection as videos are streamed live from YouTube.

The best feature of this free application is that it embeds high-quality digital recordings of 3 of my songs. In the next version, the Andyroo app will synchronize with my Andyroo.com web domain to download 3 different songs on a rotating basis for variety.  The next version will also feature a Tour+ tab view that pulls band updates and tour information, and the music video list will also be updated and expanded through synchronization with Andyroo.com. 

The app is still a work in progress, and not quite ready for the app store, but should be ready soon. Enjoy!
